Simple CLI Calculator

This Python program is a command-line interface (CLI) calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator handles user input and executes the appropriate mathematical operation based on the selected operator.

 Features:
- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`) with error handling for division by zero.

 How it works:
- The user is prompted to input two numbers and select an operation.

- The program calls the corresponding function (add(), subtract(),multiply (), or divide()) to perform the calculation.

- If the user enters invalid input (e.g., non-numeric values or an invalid operator), the program will display an error message and prompt for valid input.

- After each calculation, the user is asked whether they would like to perform another calculation.

 Error Handling:
- Division by zero is checked and handled gracefully with an error message.
- Invalid input (non-numeric values) is caught and prompts the user to re-enter valid numbers.

This program is simple and user-friendly, making it a handy tool for performing basic arithmetic operations in the terminal.
